        <div>
            <p class="gameinfoFeaturesListContainerTitle">
                Why I got kicked and can't join the server?
            </p>
            <p class="gameinfoFeaturesListContainerDesc">
                Answer: Because you need to accept the server's resourcepack. We will not allow our
                players to play the server if resources was not downloaded. You might get annoyed with
                the chinese characters and not be able to see new items.

                Answer: It is possible that your account has been banned.
                When you break one of our rules, you will be banned automatically or manually.
